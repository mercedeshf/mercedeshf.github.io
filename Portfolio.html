        <h2>Task 1</h2>
        <p> 
        My first two charts, taken from the Economics Observatory (economicsobservatory.com), about GDP and life expectancy! 
        </p>

       <p> 
        Chart 1:

    <div>
        <figure id="Location1"></figure>
    </div>

        Chart 2:

        <h2>Task 2</h2>
        <p> 
        These two charts were created using the Economics Observatory "create" tool. 
        </p>
    </div>

       <p> 
        Chart 1: Nuclear power in Japan. I found this interesting because after the Fukushima Disaster in 2011, Japan almost stopped nuclear power generation.
       </p>
       
    <div>
        <figure id="Location3"></figure>
    </div>

      <p> 
        Chart 2: Ukrainian refugees. I found this interesting because after Russia invaded Ukraine, there was clearly a spike in refugees.

        <figure id="Location4"></figure>
